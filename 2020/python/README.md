# adventofcode_py_2020
My solutions to the 2020 Advent of Code challenge. A couple of notes on my approach:

1. Solve quickly, regardless of the ugliness or brute force nature of the approach.
2. Revisit and optimize.
3. Ensure tests and linters are passing.
4. Time permitting, GOTO 2

All solutions written in Python 3.8.3
